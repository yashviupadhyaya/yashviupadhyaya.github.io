		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Introduction</h3>
		<p>Research in the form of semi-structured interviews with speech therapists and experts in the field of teaching speech to the hearing impaired was conducted to understand the problems that hearing impairment pose in learning speech and the shortcomings of the existing market solutions. Visits were made to schools for the hearing impaired children, to understand how the process of learning takes place in these institutions. The questions asked in the interviews, mainly focus on the methods and challenges that the therapists, as well as the children, face in the speech learning process. Following are the predetermined questions that were asked during these interviews: </p>

<!-- 		<h3>User Flow</h3>
 -->		<div class="para" style="margin-bottom: 5rem; ">
		<p>Minutes of the interview were noted. From the data provided by the speech therapists and teachers, along with further understanding from online references, qualitative data were analysed. Major observations made are as follows:</p>

		<h3 style="">FINDINGS FROM THE INTERVIEWS</h3><br>
		<ul>

		<li>
			<h4>Different cases </h4>
			<p>There are several types of people who need speech therapy: children born with hearing impairment, people with biological defects in the speech organs like clipped lip, clipped palate, children suffering with autism, delayed learning disorder, stammering, tongue-tie, people who due to some accident or trauma lost their ability to form proper speech, etcetera. The process of speech therapy differs from person to person. Cases involving children are treated differently from those involving adults. It is on the speech therapist’s discretion, how they want to proceed with the treatment for each case. Therefore, therapy for every case should be personalised.</p></li><br>

		<li>
			<h4>Factors affecting the process of speech therapy</h4>
			<p>The cause of speech impairment and the age of the patient are very important factors. The time it takes for speech therapy to show improvement, increases with age to a certain extent. Young children respond to speech therapy very fast as compared to older children or adults. This is because young children (mostly under the age of 5) are fast learners. After a certain age, the psychology of the patient also starts affecting the speech therapy process. Patients become more aware of their disability and due to social reasons may become reserved and hesitant to speak. Breaking the ice with these patients can take time and only after that does a patient become comfortable with their speech therapist and speech therapy starts showing results.</p></li><br>
		<li>
			<h4>Speech and language therapy</h4>
			<p>Mainly speech exercises can be divided into focusing on two parts - the verbal output(the speech) and the language part. The verbal output is only the sound which comes out and the language part consists of the vocabulary, the grammar, the formation of sentences etc. If dealing with both it is called speech and language therapy. Languages are divided into groups and each group has a particular set of phonemes. Indian languages belong to the group of Aryan languages and have a defined set of phonemes using combinations of which you can form pronunciations of words in any Indian language. International Phonetic Alphabet(IPA) is a system for phonetic notations which contain the standardized representation of sounds for spoken languages.</p></li><br>
		<li>
			<h4>Learning vowel and consonant sounds</h4>
			<p>Vowels form the basis of learning other sounds i.e. consonant sounds. The speech teaching process includes learning of vowel sounds and then the consonants sounds. Vowels sounds have different articulation positions and variations, thus are easier to teach and learn. After one learns to pronounce vowel sounds, the therapist checks what are the sounds that the case already knows to pronounce. The only task is recognition by the case that he/she is pronouncing which sound. After an acceptable range of sound is known, they learning shifts to words where all words containing a particular sound occurring at different positions are taught.</p></li>

			<h5><li style="margin-bottom: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; ">How important it is to understand what the user needs. After interviewing the visually impaired people, the observations and user inputs helped me understand the problem. I learnt that understanding the problem clearly is half way to the solution.</li></h5>
			<h5><li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Voice interfacing has certain limitations. These systems do not work well in noisy enviornment. Therefore, these systems need external devices to be effective. For the system to work efficiently I made use of noise cancelling microphones.</li></h5>
			<h5><li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">I followed the Human centered approach for developing the system.</li></h5>
